process had 3 rounds (all elimination) 👇

🔹 Round 1 – Core Java + DSA
1️⃣ How would you handle a race condition in a multithreaded program?
2️⃣ You have a list of 1M integers → find the first non-repeating number efficiently.
3️⃣ Implement an LRU Cache with O(1) operations.
4️⃣ Merge two sorted arrays in O(m+n) without extra space.
5️⃣ Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.
6️⃣ How would you detect and resolve a deadlock in Java?
7️⃣ Debugging: A Java app is showing OutOfMemoryError – how do you fix it?
8️⃣ Write code to perform level-order traversal of a binary tree.

🔹 Round 2 – Spring Boot + Microservices
1️⃣ Walk me through what happens when you hit a Spring Boot API (Controller → Service → Repository).
2️⃣ You deployed a service, but it’s taking too long to start → how do you optimize?
3️⃣ How would you implement rate limiting in Spring Boot (per user / per API)?
4️⃣ Your API depends on another service that fails intermittently → how do you add resilience & retries?
5️⃣ Two microservices need to update data in different DBs → how do you ensure transaction consistency?
6️⃣ How do you handle circular dependencies in Spring?
7️⃣ You need to log every API request/response → what’s the best approach?
8️⃣ If multiple services need a common config, how do you implement a centralized config system?

🔹 Round 3 – Database + System Design
1️⃣ A SQL query is running very slow in prod → how do you debug & fix it?
2️⃣ Design a transactional money transfer API ensuring idempotency.
3️⃣ In a high-traffic system, how do you ensure consistent reads & writes across DB replicas?
4️⃣ How would you design a real-time notification service (email + push + retries)?
5️⃣ How do you handle schema changes in production without downtime?
6️⃣ Design a collaborative Postman collection sync system (like Google Docs).
7️⃣ You need to store billions of API request logs – how would you design the DB + storage?

💡 My Experience:
The interviewers went deep into backend fundamentals – Java concurrency, Spring Boot internals, SQL performance, and system design.
They cared less about syntax and more about how I think through scalability, reliability & resilience.

🔥 Tip for backend aspirants: Don’t just practice DSA. Learn to connect Java + Spring Boot + Databases + System Design → that’s the real interview game.
