## Advantages of Spring

1. Easy to Set Up and Use
* Provides pre-configured settings and conventions to quickly bootstrap applications.
* Reduces boilerplate code and XML configuration.

2. Microservices-Friendly
* Ideal for developing microservices architecture.
* Supports embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, allowing self-contained applications.

3. Spring Ecosystem Integration
* Seamless integration with Spring Framework features like Spring Data, Spring Security, and Spring Cloud.
* Supports reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.

4. Auto Configuration
* Automatically configures application components based on the classpath dependencies.
* Reduces the need for manual configuration.

5. Embedded Servers
* Comes with embedded servers, so applications can run without requiring external application servers.

6. Production-Ready Features
* Built-in health checks, metrics, and monitoring via Spring Boot Actuator.
* Supports logging frameworks like Logback and Log4j2.

7. Simplified Dependency Management
* Uses Spring Boot Starter dependencies to bundle related libraries together.
* Managed by Maven or Gradle for easy dependency resolution.

8. Externalized Configuration
* Supports application properties and YAML files for flexible configuration.
* Environment-specific configurations can be managed easily.

9. Security and Authentication
* Easily integrates with Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
* Supports OAuth2, JWT, and basic authentication mechanisms.

10. Developer Productivity
* Provides Spring Boot DevTools for automatic restart and live reload.
* Works well with IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code.

11. Cloud-Native Capabilities
* Works well with containerization tools like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
* Easily integrates with cloud services using Spring Cloud.

12. REST API Development
* Simplifies the creation of RESTful web services with Spring Web.
* Supports JSON and XML responses with Jackson and JAXB.


## How AutoConfiguration Works ?

Auto-configuration in Spring Boot automatically sets up application components based on:
* The presence of specific classes or libraries in the classpath.
* The values defined in application.properties or application.yml.
* The default configurations provided by Spring Boot starters.

This removes the need for manually defining most configurations, making development faster.


### How AutoConfiguration Works

**Step 1: Identifying Auto-Configuration Candidates**

Spring Boot looks for auto-configuration classes specified in META-INF/spring/ files:
* META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports (Spring Boot 3+)
* META-INF/spring.factories (Spring Boot 2.x)

These files list available auto-configuration classes.

**Step 2: Conditional Activation**

Auto-configuration classes often use conditional annotations to enable configurations only when certain conditions are met:
* @ConditionalOnClass â€“ Activates if a specific class is on the classpath.
* @ConditionalOnMissingBean â€“ Activates only if a particular bean is not already defined.
* @ConditionalOnProperty â€“ Activates if a specific property is set in application.properties.
* @ConditionalOnWebApplication â€“ Activates if itâ€™s a web application.

**Step 3: Bean Registration**

When conditions are met, Spring Boot automatically registers the necessary beans in the application context.


### Custom Auto-Configuration

#### Step 1: custom auto-configuration for a MyService class:

```java
package com.example.service;

public class MyService {
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello from MyService!";
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: AutoConfiguratio Class

```java
package com.example.config;

import com.example.service.MyService;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Conditional;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnMissingBean;

@AutoConfiguration
public class MyAutoConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```

* ***The @AutoConfiguration annotation tells Spring Boot that this is an auto-configuration class.***
* ***@ConditionalOnMissingBean ensures that MyService is only registered if no existing bean of this type is already present.***

#### Step 3: Register MyAutoConfiguration class manually

**Create a file:**
ðŸ“„ META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports

Contents :
```
com.example.config.MyAutoConfiguration
```

**This tells Spring Boot to include MyAutoConfiguration in the auto-configuration process.**

### Overriding Auto-Configuration

Spring Boot allows you to override auto-configured beans by defining your own beans with the same type in your application.

```java

@Bean
public MyService customMyService() {
    return new MyService() {
        @Override
        public String sayHello() {
            return "Custom Hello!";
        }
    };
}
```

**This will replace the default auto-configured MyService.**

### Disabling Auto-Configuration

If you want to disable specific auto-configurations, you can use:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = MyAutoConfiguration.class)
```

**OR**

in application.properties:

```
spring.autoconfigure.exclude=com.example.config.MyAutoConfiguration
```
