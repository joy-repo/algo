1. Implement Custom - Executor Service -> [CustomexecutorService2.java](..%2F..%2F..%2Fdsa%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fjava%2Fconcurrency_probs%2FCustomexecutorService2.java)
2. Producer-Consumer using wait-notify -> [ProducerConsumer_WaitNotify.java](..%2F..%2F..%2Fdsa%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fjava%2Fconcurrency_probs%2FProducerConsumer_WaitNotify.java)
3. Producer-Consumer using Reentrant Lock
4. Odd-Even  with 2/multi thread problem
5. Custom Implementation of Blocking Queue



## How to implement Multi-threaded and non-blocking
* Maps - concurrentHashMap. alternate to segmentation
* Stack
* Queue
* List - CopyOnWriteArrayList is optimised for read Heavy .
